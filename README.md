2. Implement WebSocket connections for real-time communication.

#### D. Chat Interface

1. Design the chat interface using Material UI components.
2. Implement the functionality to send and receive messages.

#### E. User List and Presence

1. Display a list of online users.
2. Implement a feature to show the online/offline status of users.

#### F. Message History

1. Store and retrieve chat history, displaying it in the chat interface.

#### G. Testing and Debugging
